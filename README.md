# Quantum Chemistry
Please see my projects about simulation of molecules with quantum simulators and quantum computers in the folders!

## Notable Results:
### 1. State Inpired Ansatz of H<sub>2</sub> <br /> (a low-depth quantum circuit ansatz that has similar accuracy as  the UCCSD ansatz)
| *State Inpired Ansatz with One Parameter* | *Potential Energy Surface of H<sub>2</sub>* |
